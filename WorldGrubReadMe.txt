A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Technologies used:

1. HEML & CSS
2. Ruby on Rails
3. Bootstrap
4. Bourbon, Neat and Bitters proved to be a cluster

1. Approach
 Chose to build a recipe web page but honestly I think another topic would have been better.  Mostly because of the API approach.  Information was not directly provided and I had to go to 2 APIs to get what I needed.  Big Oven would have been way better but the $$$ was a factor.
Also a few lessons learned:
1. Keep it simple
2. Research APIs better
3. Donâ€™t introduce new technologies at beginning.  Get stuff done and then experiment.

Unsolved problems:
1. I have a big bug on displaying ingredients.  Will fix this weekend.
2. My favorites needs beautifying and able to delete a favorite.
